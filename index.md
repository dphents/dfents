## Welcome to my Blog

My Name Is Dan Fenton, and I am looking for positions in Data Science. I am currently working through this book: https://amzn.to/2S1QAWp in order to build my skills in Data Science, specifically building Deep Learning models with fast.ai and PyTorch. I've created this blog to document what I have learned, and hopefully it will help others! Thanks for checking it out!
